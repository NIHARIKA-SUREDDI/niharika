22. Explain the difference between parameters and return values in a function.
Parameters in a Function:
Parameters are variables declared within the parentheses of a function's declaration.
Return Values in a Function:
When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
A return value is the value that a function sends back to the code that called it.

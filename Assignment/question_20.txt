20. How does a `while` loop differ from a `do while` loop?
 while loop  through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
Syntax:
while (condition) 
{
  
}
Do while loop:
This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.
Syntax:
do
 {
  
}
while (condition);

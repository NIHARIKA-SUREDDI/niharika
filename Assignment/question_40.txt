 Describe the concept of event propagation and its phases.
 Event propagation is a way of defining the element order when an event occurs.
 There are two ways of event propagation in the HTML DOM,
 1. bubbling 
 2. capturing.
 bubbling:
 In bubbling the inner most element's event is handled first and then the outer: the <p> element's click event is handled first,
then the <div> element's click event.
capturing:
In capturing the outer most element's event is handled first and then the inner: the <div> element's click event will be handled first, 
then the <p> element's click event.

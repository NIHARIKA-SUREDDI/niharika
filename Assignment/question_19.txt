19. Provide an example of a `for` loop and explain its components.

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) 
{
    console.log(i);     
}
components:
Expression 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (let i = 0).

Expression 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 5).

Expression 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed.
